SAM simultaneously minimizes loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, it seeks parameters that lie in **neighborhoods having uniformly low loss**. SAM improves model generalization and yields [SoTA performance for several datasets](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/sharpness-aware-minimization-for-efficiently-1). Additionally, it provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by SoTA procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels.

This is an **unofficial** repository for [Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412). Implementation-wise, SAM class is a light wrapper that computes the regularized "sharpness-aware" gradient, which is used by the underlying optimizer (such as SGD with momentum). This repository also includes a simple [WRN for Cifar10](project); as a proof-of-concept, it beats the performance of SGD with momentum on this dataset.

## Usage

It should be straightforward to use SAM in your training pipeline. Just keep in mind that the training will run twice as slow, because SAM needs two forward-backward passes to estime the "sharpness-aware" gradient. If you're using gradient clipping, make sure to change only the magnitude of gradients, not their direction.

```python
from sam import SAM
...

model = YourModel()
base_optimizer = torch.optim.SGD  # define an optimizer for the "sharpness-aware" update
optimizer = SAM(model.parameters(), base_optimizer, lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)
...

for input, output in data:

  # first forward-backward pass
  loss = loss_function(output, model(input))  # use this loss for any training statistics
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.first_step(zero_grad=True)
  
  # second forward-backward pass
  loss_function(output, model(input)).backward()
  optimizer.second_step(zero_grad=True)
...
```

## Documentation

#### `SAM.__init__`

| **Argument**    | **Description** |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| `params` (iterable) | iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining parameter groups |
| `base_optimizer` (torch.optim.Optimizer) | underlying optimizer that does the "sharpness-aware" update |
| `rho` (float, optional)           | size of the neighborhood for computing the max loss *(default: 0.05)* |
| `**kwargs` | keyword arguments passed to the `__init__` method of `base_optimizer` |

<br>

#### `SAM.first_step`

Performs the first optimization step that finds the weights with the highest loss in the local `rho`-neighborhood.

| **Argument**    | **Description** |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| `zero_grad` (bool, optional) | set to True if you want to automatically zero-out all gradients after this step *(default: False)* |

<br>

#### `SAM.second_step`

Performs the second optimization step that updates the original weights with the gradient from the (locally) highest point in the loss landscape.

| **Argument**    | **Description** |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| `zero_grad` (bool, optional) | set to True if you want to automatically zero-out all gradients after this step *(default: False)* |

## Experiments

I've verified that SAM works on a simple WRN 16-8 model run on CIFAR10; you can replicate the experiment by running [train.py](project/train.py). The Wide-ResNet is enhanced only by label smoothing and the most basic image augmentations with cutout, so the errors are higher than those in the [SAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412). Theoretically, you can get even lower errors by running for longer (1800 epochs instead of 200), because SAM shouldn't be as prone to overfitting.

| Optimizer            | Test error rate |
| :------------------- |   -----: |
| SGD + momentum       |   3.35 % |
| SAM + SGD + momentum |   2.98 % |
